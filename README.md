Analyze Star Wars survey to determine which episode rated as the best

Link to Jupyter Notebook: [notebook](Basics.ipynb)

My analysis shows that:
- The episode with highest ranking was Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back.
- The episode with lowest ranking was Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith.
- The 3 last episodes in the series have higher ranking than the three first one.
- The rating corresponded with the number of views, and this is true for both male and female respondents.
